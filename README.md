# Fibonacci Sequence Program

## Overview
This is a simple Python program that generates and prints the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.

## How It Works
- The user inputs the number of terms they want in the Fibonacci sequence.
- The program computes and displays the sequence starting from 0 and 1.
- The program handles invalid input by prompting the user to input a positive integer.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `fibonacci.py` file in a Python environment (such as Jupyter Notebook, VSCode, or a terminal).
3. Run the program, and when prompted, input the number of terms you'd like in the Fibonacci sequence.

Example:
```bash
Enter the number of terms: 6
Fibonacci sequence up to 6 terms:
0 1 1 2 3 5
